# RL_Assignment

## Training the agent
All the code to train the agent is in the file RL_Assignment.ipynb. This file is divided into sections for defining the agents,training the agents and evaluating the agents.

Please not that the notebook was written with Google Colab in mind and has a few cells which will install all the necessary libraries.

## Running the agent
The file MyAgent.py has can be imported to make a REINFORCE based agent by loading a model file. Please note that you will have to make this weights file by training the agent in the notebbok first.
